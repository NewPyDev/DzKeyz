# Key Management System Fix

## Problem Identified
‚ùå **CRITICAL ISSUE**: When adding products with multiple license keys, the system was sending ALL keys to EVERY customer instead of one key per order.

**Example of the problem:**
- Admin adds 10 keys: `a1a1a1a1a1a1`, `a2a2a2a2a2a2`, etc.
- Customer orders 1 product
- Customer receives ALL 10 keys in email/Telegram

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Database Structure
Created `product_keys` table to manage individual keys:
```sql
CREATE TABLE product_keys (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    product_id INTEGER,
    key_value TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    used_by_order_id INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    used_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

### 2. Updated Product Creation
- When admin adds a key product with multiple keys (separated by new lines)
- Each key is stored as a separate record in `product_keys` table
- Stock count automatically matches the number of keys added
- Product's `file_or_key_path` is set to `'MANAGED_KEYS'` (placeholder)

### 3. Individual Key Assignment
- **`get_available_key(product_id, order_id)`** function gets ONE unused key
- Marks the key as used and assigns it to the specific order
- Returns the single key value for delivery
- If no keys available, returns `None`

### 4. Proper Stock Management
- **Key products**: Stock count reflects available unused keys
- **File products**: Traditional stock decrease (stock - 1)
- Stock updates automatically when keys are used
- Prevents overselling when keys run out

### 5. Single Key Delivery
- **Email**: Customer receives exactly ONE key
- **Telegram**: Customer receives exactly ONE key
- **Admin tracking**: Each key is linked to specific order
- **Audit trail**: Track which customer got which key

## Before vs After

### ‚ùå Before (BROKEN)
```
Admin adds: KEY001, KEY002, KEY003, KEY004, KEY005
Customer 1 orders ‚Üí Gets: KEY001, KEY002, KEY003, KEY004, KEY005
Customer 2 orders ‚Üí Gets: KEY001, KEY002, KEY003, KEY004, KEY005
Result: 5 keys sold to 2 customers = 10 keys given away!
```

### ‚úÖ After (FIXED)
```
Admin adds: KEY001, KEY002, KEY003, KEY004, KEY005
Customer 1 orders ‚Üí Gets: KEY001 only
Customer 2 orders ‚Üí Gets: KEY002 only
Customer 3 orders ‚Üí Gets: KEY003 only
Customer 4 orders ‚Üí Gets: KEY004 only
Customer 5 orders ‚Üí Gets: KEY005 only
Customer 6 orders ‚Üí Gets: "No keys available" (out of stock)
Result: 5 keys sold to 5 customers = 5 keys given away ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Functions
1. **`init_db()`** - Added `product_keys` table creation
2. **`add_product()`** - Splits multiple keys and stores individually
3. **`get_available_key()`** - NEW: Gets one unused key per order
4. **`deliver_product()`** - Uses single key for both email and Telegram
5. **`confirm_order()`** - Proper stock management for key products

### Key Features

## Testing Results
‚úÖ **All tests passed:**
