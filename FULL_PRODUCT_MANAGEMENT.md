## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Management System:
```sql
-- Delete individual unused keys
DELETE FROM product_keys WHERE id = ? AND is_used = FALSE

-- Add new keys with duplicate prevention
INSERT INTO product_keys (product_id, key_value) 
SELECT ?, ? WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM product_keys WHERE product_id = ? AND key_value = ?
)

-- Auto-update stock based on available keys
UPDATE products SET stock_count = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_keys 
    WHERE product_id = ? AND is_used = FALSE
)
```

### File Management System:
```python
# Replace file with cleanup
if old_file_exists:
    os.remove(old_file_path)  # Delete old file
    
new_file.save(new_file_path)  # Save new file
conn.execute('UPDATE products SET file_or_key_path = ?', (new_file_path,))
```
