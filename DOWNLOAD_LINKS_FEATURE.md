# ðŸ”— Automatic Download Links Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically generates secure download links for file products and includes them in confirmation emails, replacing the "Contact us for the link" message.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Link Generation**
- When a file product order is confirmed, a unique download token is generated
- The token is valid for **48 hours** and allows **up to 3 downloads**
- Download link format: `https://yourdomain.com/download/{unique-token}`

### 2. **Email Integration**
- **Before**: "Contact us for the link"
- **After**: "Download your product here: https://yourdomain.com/download/abc123..."
- Same email design and styling, just the link text changes

### 3. **Security Features**
- **Unique tokens**: Each download link uses a UUID4 token
- **Time expiry**: Links expire after 48 hours
- **Download limits**: Maximum 3 downloads per token
- **File validation**: Checks if file exists before serving
- **Usage tracking**: Logs all download attempts

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
# Base URL for download links (change to your domain)
BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### Database
A new table `download_tokens` is automatically created with:
- Token management
- Expiry tracking
- Download counting
- Usage logging

## Admin Features

### Download Tokens Management
- Visit `/admin/download-tokens` to view all tokens
- See download status, usage count, and expiry dates
- Monitor customer download activity

### Token Information
- **Token**: Unique identifier (UUID4)
- **Order**: Associated order number
- **Customer**: Buyer information
- **Product**: Downloaded product name
- **Downloads**: Usage count (e.g., 2/3)
- **Status**: Active, Exhausted, or Expired
- **Expires**: Expiration date/time

## Customer Experience

### Email Content Example
```
Your order has been confirmed and your product is ready!

Order Details:
- Order ID: #123
- Product: Premium Software Package
- Price: 5,000 DZD
- Payment Method: BARIDIMOB

Download your product here: https://yourdomain.com/download/abc123-def456-ghi789
(This link expires in 48 hours and allows up to 3 downloads)

Thank you for choosing Your Store!
```

### Download Process
1. Customer clicks the download link from email
2. System validates token (not expired, not exhausted)
3. File is served with proper filename
4. Download count is incremented
5. Customer gets the file instantly

### Error Handling
- **Invalid Link**: "This download link is not valid"
- **Expired Link**: "This download link has expired (48 hours limit)"
- **Exhausted**: "This download link has reached its maximum usage limit"
- **File Missing**: "The requested file is no longer available"

## Technical Details

### Routes
- `GET /download/<token>` - Secure download endpoint
- `GET /admin/download-tokens` - Admin token management

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE download_tokens (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    order_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    is_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    used_at TIMESTAMP,
    download_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    max_downloads INTEGER DEFAULT 3
);
```

### Security Considerations
- Tokens are UUIDs (cryptographically secure)
- No directory traversal possible
- File existence validated before serving
- Download limits prevent abuse
- Time-based expiry prevents long-term access
- Admin-only token management
