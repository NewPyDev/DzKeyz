## Technical Implementation

### Database Operations:
```sql
-- Edit basic product info
UPDATE products SET name = ?, description = ?, price_dzd = ? WHERE id = ?

-- Add new keys (with duplicate prevention)
INSERT INTO product_keys (product_id, key_value) VALUES (?, ?)

-- Update stock count for key products
UPDATE products SET stock_count = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_keys 
    WHERE product_id = ? AND is_used = FALSE
) WHERE id = ?

-- Delete product (with constraint checking)
DELETE FROM products WHERE id = ? AND id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM orders
)
```

### Safety Features:
- **Order Constraint**: Cannot delete products with existing orders
