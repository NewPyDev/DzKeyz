# Telegram & Email Fixes - DZ AutoShop

## 🐛 **Issues Identified and Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Telegram Confirm Button Not Working**
**Root Cause:** 
- The `deliver_product()` function was being called with incomplete order data
- In both admin and Telegram webhook confirmations, the function was called with the original `order` object instead of the complete `updated_order` object
- The original order object was missing critical fields like `type`, `file_or_key_path`, and `price_dzd`

**Solution Applied:**
```python
# Before (causing errors)
deliver_product(order)  # Missing fields

# After (fixed)
deliver_product(updated_order)  # Complete order data with all fields
```

### **Issue 2: Email Sending Not Working**
**Root Cause:**
- Email function was working correctly, but wasn't being called due to the above issue
- When `deliver_product()` crashed due to missing fields, email sending was never reached

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed the order data issue (above)
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track email sending
- Verified email configuration is correct

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Admin Confirm Order Function**
**File:** `app.py` - `confirm_order()` function

**Fixed:**
```python
# Get complete order data including type and file_or_key_path
updated_order = conn.execute('''SELECT o.*, p.name as product_name, p.type, p.file_or_key_path, p.price_dzd
                               FROM orders o 
                               JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id 
                               WHERE o.id = ?''', (order_id,)).fetchone()

# Use complete order data for delivery
deliver_product(updated_order)  # Instead of deliver_product(order)
```

### **2. Telegram Webhook Function**
**File:** `app.py` - `telegram_webhook()` function

**Fixed:**
```python
# Get complete order data for delivery
updated_order = conn.execute('''SELECT o.*, p.name as product_name, p.type, p.file_or_key_path, p.price_dzd
                               FROM orders o 
                               JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id 
                               WHERE o.id = ?''', (order_id,)).fetchone()

# Use complete order data for delivery
deliver_product(updated_order)  # Instead of deliver_product(order)
```

### **3. Enhanced Debug Logging**
**Added comprehensive logging to track:**
- Webhook reception and processing
- Order confirmation steps
- Email sending attempts
- Telegram message sending
- Product delivery completion

**Debug Output Examples:**
```
🔔 Telegram webhook received
📨 Webhook data: {...}
🔘 Callback data: confirm_123
✅ Confirming order #123
🔄 Delivering product for order #123
📧 Sending confirmation email to user@example.com
📱 Sending Telegram message to @username
✅ Product delivery completed for order #123
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Order Data Structure Required**
The `deliver_product()` function needs these fields:
- `id` - Order ID
- `buyer_name` - Customer name
- `email` - Customer email
- `telegram_username` - Customer Telegram (optional)
- `product_name` - Product name
- `type` - Product type ('key' or 'file')
- `file_or_key_path` - Product key or file path
- `price_dzd` - Product price
- `payment_method` - Payment method

### **Database Queries Updated**
Both confirmation functions now use complete queries:
```sql
SELECT o.*, p.name as product_name, p.type, p.file_or_key_path, p.price_dzd
FROM orders o 
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id 
WHERE o.id = ?
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Email Function Test**
```
✅ Email sent successfully to test@example.com
✅ Email function working: True
```

### **Telegram Function Test**
```
✅ Telegram function working: True
```

### **App Integration Test**
```
✅ Flask app imports successfully
